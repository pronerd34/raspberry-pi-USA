# raspberry-pi-USA
first boot startup script to change locale information to US outside of raspi-config.

must be run as root!  use "sudo ./raspberry-pi-USA". Be sure to 'chmod 755' the script after downloading.

The variables are set for my location and hardware, but can be easily modified.

I've worked out what was needed to prevent some of the error messages that pop up, so if you run the script
once it will reboot and you should be set up for the typical US setup.
